# Network Security Challenge: Investigating Anomalies at RockStar Corp

In this lab, I conducted an in-depth investigation into unusual network behavior reported in RockStar Corp's Hollywood office. My analysis included identifying active network assets, performing vulnerability scans, executing penetration tests, and conducting forensic analysis. Through network reconnaissance, I discovered responsive IPs, analyzed open ports, and tested authentication mechanisms. Additionally, I examined DNS anomalies affecting access to rollingstone.com, analyzed packet captures for suspicious activity, and investigated unauthorized system modifications. This hands-on experience strengthened my ability to detect and mitigate security threats within a real-world network environment </br>

Key Tasks:
</br>

-  <b>Network Layout Design</b>: Utilized draw.io to create a secure and scalable network layout for Acme Corp's new Shanghai office.</br>
-  <b>Security Device Integration</b>: Incorporated network security devices such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and VPNs to safeguard the network against cyberattacks.</br>
-  <b>DNS Spoofing Simulation</b>: Created and tested a DNS spoof record to prevent unauthorized access to Acme Corp's sensitive website, acmetradesecrets.com, by redirecting potential hackers to a safe destination.</br>
