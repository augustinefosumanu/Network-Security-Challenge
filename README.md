# Network Security Challenge: Investigating Anomalies at RockStar Corp
<b>Overview</b>

In this lab, I conducted an in-depth investigation into unusual network behavior reported in RockStar Corp's Hollywood office. My analysis included identifying active network assets, performing vulnerability scans, executing penetration tests, and conducting forensic analysis. Through network reconnaissance, I discovered responsive IPs, analyzed open ports, and tested authentication mechanisms. Additionally, I examined DNS anomalies affecting access to rollingstone.com, analyzed packet captures for suspicious activity, and investigated unauthorized system modifications. <b>This hands-on experience strengthened my ability to detect and mitigate security threats within a real-world network environment.</b> </br>

<b>Technical Skills:</b>

✅ Network security (scanning, reconnaissance, and access control) </br>
✅ Ethical hacking & penetration testing (port scanning, authentication testing) </br>
✅ Digital forensics (packet analysis, intrusion detection) </br>
✅ Incident response (modification tracking, firewall investigation) </br>
✅ System administration & hardening (config file auditing, SSH security) </br>
